Given 2 numbers m and n. We need to convert a number m to n with minimum operations.
The operations allowed are: -1 and *2.

Example 1.
---
m=4 and n=6 

Answer is 2 operations.

Explanation:

1st operation: -1 -> 4-1 = 3

2nd operation: *2 -> 3\*2 = 6

Example 2.
---
m=3, n=36

3\*2 -> 6-1 -> 5\*2 -> 10-1 -> 9\*2 -> 18\*2 -> 36

Answer: 6 operations
